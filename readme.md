# C# .NET Core/Angular To-Do Application

This project represents the solution to a web app challenge with the following critiera:

```
Please create a .NET Web App ’To-Do’ application.  Functionality should include:

- Add a To-Do
- Edit a To-Do
- Complete a To-Do

Bonus points for using any of the following:

- .NET Core
- Dependency Injection
- Unit Tests
- Database Persistence
- Modern Interface

Persistence layer can be as simple as you’d like (static variables / session / whatever).  Make sure your code shows your knowledge of C#, HTML, CSS, TypeScript/JavaScript, and SOLID principals
```

Everything is self-contained inside a Visual Studio solution, so if you have Node.js installed, you should be able to just run it from Visual Studio.
